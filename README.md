# ora's linux-flavored vim

## A set of customizations for speedy development
This is the vim setup I use on Linux Systems. Feel free to use it!

__Note__: This bundle is from a Linux environment. Using it on a non-linux machine may provide less-than-complete functionality.

## Installation instructions
It is really reccomended that you download this with git. It will automate dependency resolution for you, and be a lot less painful.

### Installing with git
This is the easiest way to install this bundle, as all dependencies will be resolved for you (semi)automatically.

1. Get [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) for your linux distribution.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/orablu/vim-linux.git` to ~/.vim.
3. Download dependencies with `git submodule init` then `git submodule update` (You may need to call `git submodule update` immediately again if there is a newer version of a plugin available).
4. Symlink ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/.vimrc.

### Installing without git
Why would you do this? It's a pain!

1. Get [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php)<sup>m</sup> for your linux distribution.
2. Go through your /.vim/bundle directory, and find all empty plugin directories.
3. Find the link in this readme that points to the github repository for each missing plugin.
4. Download that plugin and place it in that folder.
5. Repeat until all plugin folders have a plugin.
6. Symlink ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/.vimrc.
7. Question yourself for ever choosing this method.

Ignoring these steps will break this vim bundle, as one of the dependencies is pathogen, the plugin that manages all the other plugins! You __must__ manually install pathogen at the very least!


## Notable customizations
If you really want to understand what is going on with this flavour of vim versus the standard distribution, I really reccomend looking through the vimrc. However, here are the most notable customisations.

### Custom keybindings
I dislike having to reach all the way to the corner to press escape all the time. So I usually rebind capslock systemwide to escape on my computers. However, I find that this little trick also is useful. Having `imap jk <esc>` and `imap kj <esc>` makes it so I can just mash `j` and `k` to return to normal mode.

I like `<c-a>` for select all. I'm just used to it. So I use `(i)map <c-a> <esc>ggVG` to emulate it.

Global copy paste is nice when interacting with other applications. So I use `map <leader>v "+p` and `map <leader>y "+y` to quickly copy to the global register.

I get annoyed by random highlights easily. And I like searching with hlsearch on, so it's nice to have a quick way to disable it after a search. `map <leader>] :noh<CR>` does the trick for me.

When I use j and k to go up and down, I expect it to go up and down. When there's word wrap, it goes to the next line. While I understand the reasoning for it, I find it annoying, and so use `map <silent> j gj` and `map <silent> k gk` to fix this.

Some nice toggles to have: `map <leader>l :setlocal number!<CR>` and `map <leader>[ :setlocal wrap!<CR>:setlocal wrap?<CR>`.

I like window splitting, but dislike the three-finger chord to navigate between them, So I use `map <c-j> <c-w>j` and the like to do it faster.

### Other customizations
There are a few other customizations of note. Most of them are minor tweaks you can see by looking at the .vimrc (it's all commented and separated nicely for you!), but here are the most significant.

I like having things fullscreen, but GVim doesn't have that functionality. So, I use [gvimfullscreen.dll](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2596)<sup>m</sup> to give it that functionality. There's a function I wrote at the bottom of the .vimrc managing how it's resized. This is bound to the regular `<f11>` that other applications use. This functionality only applies to GVim, the terminal version doesn't have this.

I also like knowing the current directory for fast file actions. So I put it in the titlebar of the window. Also, I dislike the sound of the error bell, so I disabled it.

The last notable modification is that NERDTree is set to open when a file is not given to vim on startup. Nice easy way to navigate to the file you want to edit, or if you don't want it just hit `q`.


## Notable plugins
This bundle contains multiple plugins. The most noteworthy (or the ones that have extra commands) are listed here. __Note__: These may not be up to date! I update them periodically, but go to the given link to check if there is a newer version!
